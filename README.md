A minimal 'Towers of Hanoi' animation:
A tower of 6 discs is transferred from the
left to the right peg.

An imho quite elegant and concise
implementation using a tower class, which
is derived from the built-in type list.

Discs are turtles with shape "square", but
stretched to rectangles by shapesize()
